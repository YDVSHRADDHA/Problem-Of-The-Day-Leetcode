 This collection serves as a way for me to practice and improve my problem-solving skills, focusing on algorithms and data structures. I categorize the solutions by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and update it daily with the latest challenges.

Each solution is written in Java, and I aim to enhance my understanding of different techniques and strategies while tracking my progress.
